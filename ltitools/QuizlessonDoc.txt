Quiz Lesson lets an instrutor build a page with content, including images, then insert a question selected from a quiz.
When a student answers the questions, the quiz is updated. 
Its impotant to use all questions from the same quiz.
Questions can be spread over multiple pages. 
A submit button is inserted in the page after all questions are used to submit and grade the quiz.
12/16

ToDo: TJones: glyphicon at gmail

Decide the best way to display the feedback:
    overlay onto question
    with gradeRetry() button added to feedback if not correct
    OR
    replace answers and show the correct answer
    with feedback
    DONT increase iframe height
    
Submit Answer button:
    each question needs a submit button.
    multiple_answers_question can have multiple answer ids [1,2,3]
    ADDED function to inject the selected answer.id(s) into the Submit Answer button
    button passes quiz_id, question_id, answer.id(s) to php onGradeQuestion()
    
    Selected answers are sent by their id
    https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/quiz_submission_questions.html#method.quizzes/quiz_submission_questions.answer
    Answers have different types
    https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/quiz_submission_questions.html#Question+Answer+Formats-appendix
    
Submit the Quiz button:
    clear the instance, orchidConfig: quiz_name, quiz_id and questions_used for next time
    only needs to call the onSubmitQuiz function
    user_id (studentId) and quiz_id are retrieved from SESSION in the function
    if post parameter quizid == 'submit' render the Submit Quiz button instead of questions

Get Submissions for quiz:

if (role == 'Learner' && $_POST['quiz_id'] != '') {

    Display submission data for answered questions in js render(quizid, questions) 
    renderQuestion.html retrieves var submission
    if workflow_state = complete render question + correct answer
}


Match Canvas question css? (displays kinda big, no access to canvas css)

multiple_answers_question = check boxes
multiple_choice_question = radio buttons

quiz_id, question_id, each answer has an id
Instruct user to complete one page at a time?
All questions are in a form for submit button.
How would this work for separated questions?
Does each question group need a submit? or does the submit button need question ids?

How to handle multiple pages? will each page in a course try to use the same instance?
Should a new page update the instance[name] to be unique for the page it belongs to. 
use quizid = 697065 similar to popquiz instance names?
unique name would have to come from the post and check if it has already been used upon adding questions to the page.
possibly .referrer? possibly $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']
OR
A field holds the page name or tool_consumer_instance_guid ( test if this is the same for a given page )
and instance is chosen accordingly

9/2
Cleaned up code and notes.
Figure out a solution for iframe height qhite

Dont Forget about: changes on mediafiles:
roots/components/LtiConfiguration.php 
        line 190 : replaced with $_SESSION['roles'] = $roleStr;
        line 201: $_SESSION['lms'] = $instanceFromDB['lms'];

roots/classes/Blti.php line 153 : added 
if(isset($_REQUEST["resource_link_id"])) {
    $resource_link_id = $_REQUEST["resource_link_id"];
}


NEW Plugin Configuration: 9/1
roots_quiz_question did not pull in COMMENTS?
CanvasHelper processSingleQuizQuestion looks correct but are missing in db table

after adding a question, canvas couldnt find valid settings for this link: 
Canvas has confused this tool with first orchidtest tool installed.
<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 250px;" title="Quiz Questions" src="/courses/418348/external_tools/retrieve?display=borderless&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediafiles.uvu.edu%2Fdelphinium%2Forchidtest%3Fquizid%3D697063%26questionid%3D12652261" width="300" height="150" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe>

I repaired the url manually: /quizlesson not /orchidtest! This wont happen in a new course.
Maybe Export, Reset and Import the course to get rid of the original Deleted tool orchidtest
 
The branding mark is annoying in this component. Disabled it in minimal.htm on server.
<!--div class="brand"><i><a href="https://delphinium.uvu.edu">Powered by Project Delphinium</a></i></div-->
the link should open in a new tab  target="_blank" and is currently broken.

Setting the LtiConfiguration to Editor, generates this in the config.xml
<lticm:property name="message_type">ContentItemSelectionRequest</lticm:property>
Navigation does not

content_item_return_url is sent from canvas, not LtiConfiguration
tool_consumer_info_product_family_code is not sent if lti_message_type is ContentItemSelectionRequest

if set to Navigation does doBltiHandshake ever get called? or only when lti app is installed?

first launch of Quizlesson is a ContentItemSelectionRequest within the Rich Editor

Ask Jared if any other components use Editor yet: nope 

When I select the component in the Canvas Page Rich Text Editor dropdown, 
none of the SESSION variables have been set. ['lms'], ['domain'], ['userToken']

Do you know where the SESSION varaiables get set from?

Quizlesson can get quizzes through roots if I set the variables in the component before calling roots.
I thought these were set by LtiConfiguration->doBltiHandshake but I dont see it in the error stack trace at all.
maybe LtiConfiguration only runs when the app is installed.

His reply:
We copied my code from greenhouse front end and it worked there, 
the Navigation setting we use all the time, 
but we've never really tested the Editor setting, I only know that it is based on code that worked before.

I think that LtiConfiguration only runs when installing the app.

Test removing it after install and see if Quizlesson still runs.
Confirmed Yes it does run without LtiConfiguration!!! 
LtiConfiguration only executes returnXML() ??? then doBltiHandshake?
Test only returnXML version on a new install
Test Navigation too
the custom post variables are now part of the Canvas app launch

Is there a way to add 'lms' to the config.xml custom variables?
use: $instanceFromDB['lms'] ???

======================================
8/29 use Routes to fix POST error in console
instead of $.request('onUpdateTable', ...)
$.request probably works too. 
Err was from posting autosubmit before onUpdateTable was done.
Wait till updateTable is done, then autosubmit the form!
======================================

Quiz must NOT have question groups and should be set to unlimited multiple attempts?

Orchid configuration xml uses the CMS page name for the app


REMOVED FRONT END FORM and modal tabs
KEEP instructions (needs more work)
    Instruct user to complete one page at a time.
    Added the workflow to instructions.
    
Rebuilt /updates/update_questions_used.php & version.yaml  Watch for errors at October login
upload blossom Experience to mediafiles. it show error in backend greenhouse

Each question on a page is a separate launch of the component.

One major bottleneck is repeatedly getting all quizzes for quizList.

in Quizlesson.php check if quiz_id has been selected
Done: 8/16
1st Launch: quiz_id may not be set yet
     if ($config->quiz_id == '') {
        $quizList = $this->getAllQuizzes();// to select one
    } else { 
        $quizList = $this->getQuiz($config->quiz_id);//only get selected quiz
    }
2nd launch: quiz_id is in the post
    $quizId = intval($_POST["quizid"]);
    $quizList = $this->getQuiz($quizId);

always: array of one or all quizzes
$this->page['quizList'] = $quizList;

8/26
    tested getSubmission (above) $assignment was empty because there is no entry in _roots_assignments for this course or assignment

8/25
Note:
delphinium_roots_quizzes    field description needs more than 255 chars.
                                             field allowed_attempts -1 = allow multiple attempts

8/23
Submit Quiz button inserted.
html inserted for the Submit Quiz button

<p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 60px;" title="Quiz Submit Button" src="/courses/418348/external_tools/retrieve?display=borderless&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediafiles.uvu.edu%2Fdelphinium%2Forchidtest%3Fquizid%3Dsubmit%26questionid%3D" width="300" height="150" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

authorize this app occurs way too often.
Submit quiz button displays error:

Client error: `GET https://uvu.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/418348/quizzes/0/questions?access_token=14~DYy&per_page=5000` resulted in a `404 Not Found` response: {"errors":[{"message":"The specified resource does not exist."}],"error_report_id":72359717}

Swapped out roots for an earlier version. -OLD
I ran modulemap and it asked for approval
Now orchid quizlesson. lticonfiguration is not approving context: There is a problem. Please notify your instructor
reverted back to roots 8.16
changed the token in course to the new one
reinstalled A-Quizlesson in course 418348 :  context FIXED
