Popquiz presents quiz questions in a game.
12/16

Instructor view:
Configure popquiz with lti type set to resource selection.
Add the app in Canvas.
Create an assignment, set the points and select submission type, External Tool.

The first launch will let the instructor choose a quiz.
Select some questions. You can select questions from multiple quizzes.
Use the cog to change the game style. The default game is Millionare Game Show.
The quiz name is set when a quiz is selected, it can be changed as needed and is displayed in a game.
The description is displed in a game introduction.

Select Use These Questions to finish the tool setup and preview the game.
Close the dialog modal and save the assignment.

The instructor can change the questions used in the game if desired, without editing the assignment.

Popquiz has multiple game types: Millionaire, Gameshow Challenge, YouGotThis
The assignment is graded as 100% when a student finishes the game.

Limited to multiple choice type questions.

The quiz can be unpublished if desired.

These functions must be within each game
    function showIntro() {
        stage.removeChild(exportRoot);
        handleComplete();//init();
    }

    function sendGrade() {
        if (graded) { return false; }
        graded = true;// only once
        // use RestAPI grade is always 100%
        var consumerkey = '{{consumerkey|raw}}';//Canvas: oauth_consumer_key
        var outcomeurl = '{{outcomeurl|raw}}';//Canvas: lis_outcome_service_url 
        var sourcedid = '{{sourcedid|raw}}';//Canvas: lis_result_sourcedid
        var grade = 1;// 0~1 (0.5=50%)
        //console.log('sendGrade: outcomeurl:',outcomeurl);
        if (sourcedid == 'x') { return false; }
        var promise = $.get('onGradePopquiz', {'consumerkey':consumerkey,'outcomeurl':outcomeurl,'sourcedid':sourcedid,'grade':grade}, function (data) {
            //console.log('PROMISE result:',data);
        }).fail(function (data) { console.log('PROMISE failed:',data.responseText); });
    }


ToDo:
use key to lookup secret TEST

There could be several popquizzes in a course. Use assignmentId for instance name! TEST
quiz_name just for instructor reference.

Depending on game style, define minimum questions needed within each game.Millionare = 15
Gameshow = 12
YouGotThis = 0 = unlimited

Is there a way to get question banks?
intro is description. use a generic outro

Instructor builds a multiple choice quiz. It can be unpublished.
cannot use question groups. must use individual questions in the quiz!
If questions could be selected from the database or banks directly, there is no need for quizzes.

gameshow_h5:
analizeXML function looks for categories... oops no categories
<categoryName>JAA</categoryName>
4 categories with 3 questions per category 
Used generic: Category 1, ...
