Poppies:
Use Vanilla to create the Poppies plugin and component Popquiz
bootstrap has an accordion:
http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-accordion.php
Does minimal load the bootstrap.theme?
"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css"

-replace jquery.ui : Does bootstrap have a selectable like j-UI?
-limit question count, defined by game
-add gradeMedia.php to roots? uses key to lookup secret

popquiz should be an Assignment that returns a grade
Use [Editor] in LtiConfiguration, similar to Quizlesson
content item selection modal lets you select the quiz & questions, (choose game)
basic_launch displays only the game with questions.
student launch grades media

stand alone plugin has multiple game types
Millionaire, Jeopardy, YouGotThis?, look for others
===

Use bootstrap not jqUI selection list-group and accordion
